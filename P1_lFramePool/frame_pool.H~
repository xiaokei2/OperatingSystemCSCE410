     * frame pool. This function must be called before the paging system
     * is initialized.
     * _base_frame_no is the frame number at the start of the physical memory
     *                region that this frame pool manages.
     * _nframes is the number of frames in the physical memory region that this
     *          rame pool manages.
     * e.g. If _base_frame_no is 16 and _nframes is 4, this frame pool manages
     * physical frames numbered 16, 17, 18 and 19
     * _info_frame_no is the frame number (within the directly mapped region) of
     * the frame that should be used to store the management information of the
     * frame pool. However, if _info_frame_no is 0, the frame pool is free to
     * choose any frame from the pool itself to store management information.
